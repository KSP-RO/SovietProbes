**I HIGHLY reccommend downloading my Soviet Rockets mod to use with this. It is required to launch all of these probes and you need it to use the craft files.**

So here is yet another project. This time I am working on the series of soviet probes, focusing on the luna and sputnik probes. I will also do Molniya and Polyot probes.

This is a long term project and I will slowly be adding probes to it over time.

##Remotetech Support:
* If you use remotetech, here is a module manager config to make the probes compatible: [https://www.mediafire.com/?3pnib4l165ly91z](https://www.mediafire.com/?3pnib4l165ly91z)

##NOTES ON HOW TO FLY LUNA 9:
* 1) Use Block L for trans-munar injection
* 2) When close to the Mun, decouple the ASTRO and Radio units.
* 3) Adjust your landing spot using the KTDU and vernier engines, DO NOT CIRCULARIZE!
* 4)  Slow yourself until close to the ground, deploy the ground sensor antennas, when just above the ground decouple the ALS with action key "1".
* 5) After decoupling the ALS use action group key 2 to expand the airbags.
* 6) Once the ALS touches down shrink the airbags with action group key 2 WITH SAS ON and extend the ALS panels.

##Warnings:

* Luna 9 can be incredibly buggy, you have been warned ahead of time.
* DO NOT inflate the airbags while Luna 9 ALS is still attached to the KTDU engine unit or your ship will go out of control and explode! Decouple the ALS first then inflate the airbags.
* Keep the SAS on while decoupling the airbags or your ship may bounce off the ground and make escape velocity, or it'll just explode.
* If you are experiencing FPS lag extend the ground sensors on the KTDU engine unit then retract them again and the lag should stop.
* Do not press action key 2 before 1 or it will screw up the animation sequence
